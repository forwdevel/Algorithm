Java ArrayList
      >> In Java, we use the 'ArrayList' class to implement the functionality of 'resizable-arrays'.
      >> It implement the 'List' interface of the collections framework.

Java ArrayList Vs Array
      >> In Java, we need to declare the size of an array before we can use it.
            Once the size of an array is declared, it's hard to change it.
      >> To handle this issue, we can use the 'ArrayList' class. 
            It allows us to create resizable arrays.
      >> Unlike arrays, arraylists can automatically adjust their capacity when we add or remove element from them.
            Hence, arraylists are also known as 'dynamic arrays'.

Basic Operations on ArrayList
      >> The 'ArrayList' class provides various methods to perform different operations on arraylists.
      >> We will look at some commonly used arraylist operations in this:
            >> Add elements
            >> Access elements
            >> Change elements
            >> Remove elements

Methods of ArrayList Class
      >> size() - Returns the length or the arraylist.
      >> sort() - Sort the arraylist elements.
      >> clone() - Creates a new arraylist with the same element, size, and capacity.
      >> contains() - Searches the arraylist for the specified element and returns a boolean result.
      >> ensureCapacity() - specifies the total element the arraylist can contain.
      >> isEmpty() - Checks if the arraylist is empty.
      >> indexOf() - Searches a specified element in an arraylist and returns the index of the element.
